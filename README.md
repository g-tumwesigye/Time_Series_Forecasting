# 🌐 Time_Series_Forecasting (Air Quality Forecasting)  

Predicting PM2.5 Levels Using RNN and LSTM Models for Time Series Forecasting  

---

## 📚 Project Overview  
Air pollution, especially PM2.5, is a critical global issue affecting millions of people. This project aims to build machine learning models to forecast PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing using historical air quality and weather data. Accurate forecasting can help communities take proactive measures to reduce the impact of air pollution on public health.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- Explore and preprocess sequential air quality data.  
- Design, train, and optimize Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.  
- Achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) below 4000 on the Kaggle leaderboard.  
- Document the entire process, including data exploration, model design, experiments, and results.
