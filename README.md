# 🌐 Time_Series_Forecasting (Air Quality Forecasting)  

Predicting PM2.5 Levels Using RNN and LSTM Models for Time Series Forecasting  

---

## 📚 Project Overview  
Air pollution, especially PM2.5, is a critical global issue affecting millions of people. This project aims to build machine learning models to forecast PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing using historical air quality and weather data. Accurate forecasting can help communities take proactive measures to reduce the impact of air pollution on public health.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- Explore and preprocess sequential air quality data.  
- Design, train, and optimize Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.  
- Achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) below 4000 on the Kaggle leaderboard.  
- Document the entire process, including data exploration, model design, experiments, and results.

## 📊 Data Files

* **train.csv:** Contains historical air quality data (features and target variable).
* **test.csv:** Contains air quality data without target values (used for predictions).
* **sample\_submission.csv:** Shows the required format for submitting predictions on Kaggle.

---

## 📔 Notebook

The main Jupyter notebook for this project is:

* **air\_quality\_forecasting\_starter\_code.ipynb** – Modify this notebook to include your data exploration, preprocessing, model design, training, and predictions.

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training

1. **Preprocess the Data:** Handle missing values, create sequences, and scale features.
2. **Design the Model:** Create RNN and LSTM models with optimized architectures.
3. **Train the Model:** Train and fine-tune the models to reduce RMSE.
4. **Generate Predictions:** Create predictions for the test set and submit to Kaggle.

---

## 📊 Results and Evaluation

* Record the performance of each model.
* Include at least 15 experiments with varied parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, layers).
